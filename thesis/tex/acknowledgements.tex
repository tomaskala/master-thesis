\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Kamil Dedecius for being such a positive person. It was a real pleasure to work with him, and I believe I have learned a great deal. Next, I want to thank my family for keeping me alive and well-fed. Finally, I thank my friends Luk\'a\v{s} and Petr for keeping me sane.
