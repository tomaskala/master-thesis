    abstract = {Summary In the following article, we consider approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for certain classes of time series models. In particular, we focus upon scenarios where the likelihoods of the observations and parameter are intractable, by which we mean that one cannot evaluate the likelihood even up to a non-negative unbiased estimate. This paper reviews and develops a class of approximation procedures based upon the idea of ABC, but specifically maintains the probabilistic structure of the original statistical model. This latter idea is useful, in that one can adopt or adapt established computational methods for statistical inference. Several existing results in the literature are surveyed, and novel developments with regards to computation are given.},

    abstract = {Summary Standard Bayesian algorithms used for online filtering of states of hidden Markov models from noisy measurements assume an accurate knowledge of the measurement model in the form of a conditional probability density function. However, this knowledge is often unreachable in practice, and the used models are more or less misspecified, or it is too complex, making the resulting models intractable. This paper focuses on these issues from the particle filtering perspective. It adopts the principles of the approximate Bayesian filtering, where the particle weights are based on the (dis)similarity of the true measurements and the pseudo-measurements obtained by plugging the state particles directly into the measurement equation. Specifically, a new robust method for online tuning of the weighting kernel is proposed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
