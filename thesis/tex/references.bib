In particular, we focus upon scenarios where the likelihoods of the observations and parameter are intractable, by which we mean that one cannot evaluate the likelihood even up to a non-negative unbiased estimate. This paper reviews and develops a class of approximation procedures based upon the idea of ABC, but specifically maintains the probabilistic structure of the original statistical model. This latter idea is useful, in that one can adopt or adapt established computational methods for statistical inference. Several existing results in the literature are surveyed, and novel developments with regards to computation are given.},

    abstract="Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become a popular technique to facilitate Bayesian inference from complex models. In this article we present an ABC approximation designed to perform biased filtering for a Hidden Markov Model when the likelihood function is intractable. We use a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm to both fit and sample from our ABC approximation of the target probability density. This approach is shown to, empirically, be more accurate w.r.t. the original filter than competing methods. The theoretical bias of our method is investigated; it is shown that the bias goes to zero at the expense of increased computational effort. Our approach is illustrated on a constrained sequential lasso for portfolio allocation to 15 constituents of the FTSE 100 share index.",

    abstract = {Summary Standard Bayesian algorithms used for online filtering of states of hidden Markov models from noisy measurements assume an accurate knowledge of the measurement model in the form of a conditional probability density function. However, this knowledge is often unreachable in practice, and the used models are more or less misspecified, or it is too complex, making the resulting models intractable. This paper focuses on these issues from the particle filtering perspective. It adopts the principles of the approximate Bayesian filtering, where the particle weights are based on the (dis)similarity of the true measurements and the pseudo-measurements obtained by plugging the state particles directly into the measurement equation. Specifically, a new robust method for online tuning of the weighting kernel is proposed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: Statistical inference of biological networks such as gene regulatory networks, signaling pathways and metabolic networks can contribute to build a picture of complex interactions that take place in the cell. However, biological systems considered as dynamical, non-linear and generally partially observed processes may be difficult to estimate even if the structure of interactions is given.Results: Using the same approach as Sitz et al. proposed in another context, we derive non-linear state-space models from ODEs describing biological networks. In this framework, we apply Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) to the estimation of both parameters and hidden variables of non-linear state-space models. We instantiate the method on a transcriptional regulatory model based on Hill kinetics and a signaling pathway model based on mass action kinetics. We successfully use synthetic data and experimental data to test our approach.Conclusion: This approach covers a large set of biological networks models and gives rise to simple and fast estimation algorithms. Moreover, the Bayesian tool used here directly provides uncertainty estimates on parameters and hidden states. Let us also emphasize that it can be coupled with structure inference methods used in Graphical Probabilistic Models.Availability: Matlab code available on demand.Contact:florence.dalche@ibisc.univ-evry.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available from http://amisbio.ibisc.fr/dm}",
