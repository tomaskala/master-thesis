\chapter{Attached files}
\label{chap:appendix}

The attached files contain the source codes and input data necessary to run the experiments. The main scripts used to run the simulations come with a command line interface containing a help message listing the accepted arguments. The attachment structure is specified in \autoref{tab:attached-files}.
